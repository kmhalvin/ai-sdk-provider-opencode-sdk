# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.0.0] - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- **ESM-only package** - The package no longer ships a CommonJS build (`dist/index.cjs`, `dist/index.d.cts` are gone, and the `require` export condition was removed). `@ai-sdk/provider@4` and `ai@7` are ESM-only, so v7 consumers are already ESM; CommonJS consumers must use Node `>= 22.12` `require(esm)` or migrate to `import`. The exports map uses a flat `types`/`default` shape (matching `@ai-sdk/provider`) so `require(esm)` resolves correctly.
- **AI SDK v6 maintenance line** - Version 3.x remains available for AI SDK v6 via the `ai-sdk-v6` npm tag and is maintained on the [`ai-sdk-v6`](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/tree/ai-sdk-v6) branch.
- **`@opencode-ai/sdk` bumped to `^1.18.11`** - The latest SDK renames event types from `Event*` to plain names and describes events with a `data` payload envelope instead of `properties`. The provider keeps its `Event*`-styled local event interfaces but reads each event's payload from whichever envelope a server emits (`properties` or `data`, treated as optional), so it works with current and future OpenCode servers and older SDKs/servers alike.
- **AI SDK v7 migration** - The provider now implements the V4 provider interfaces (`LanguageModelV4` / `ProviderV4`, `specificationVersion: "v4"`) and requires `@ai-sdk/provider ^4.0.4`, `@ai-sdk/provider-utils ^5.0.18`, and `ai ^7.0.47`. `reasoning` model call options are unsupported (warned and ignored via `logUnsupportedCallOptions`), and `reasoning-file` output parts are converted as a no-op with debug logging.
- **Node.js >= 22** - The package now requires **Node.js >= 22** and is built for the `node22` target. The CI matrix covers Node 22 and 24.
- **File data parts** - Per AI SDK v7, `reference` file input parts are unsupported and skipped with a warning.

### Fixed

- **Silent permission reply failures** ([#35](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/35)) - `replyToPendingApprovals` never inspected the resolved value of `permission.reply`. Managed clients use `responseStyle: "fields"` without `throwOnError`, so API-level failures resolve as `{ error }` instead of throwing — a failed reply was silently recorded as replied and never retried, leaving OpenCode waiting on the permission request. The result is now checked via `extractSdkResult` (matching the question-reply handling): on error, a warning is logged and surfaced in the response `warnings`, and the approval id is not recorded as replied so the next turn retries it.

## [3.0.6] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **Process hang from leaked `/event` SSE connection** ([#30](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/30)) - `doStream` passes a per-stream `AbortController` signal to `client.event.subscribe` and aborts it when the stream closes (before `iterator.return()`, which could otherwise block until the next server event). Previously the SSE iterator's `return()` only released its reader lock without cancelling the underlying fetch, so the `GET /event` connection stayed open and kept the Node event loop alive after streaming finished — `examples/abort-signal.ts` intermittently never exited after printing "Done.". The client manager tracks these controllers (`registerEventSubscription`) and aborts any still open during `dispose()`.
- **Streaming `session.prompt` and `session.abort` requests cancelled on stream close** ([#31](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/31)) - The per-stream abort signal from [#30](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/30) is now also passed to the `session.prompt` and `session.abort` requests, so a prompt the server never completes (e.g. after an abort race) cannot pin the event loop, and `dispose()` tears these requests down too. Prompt results that arrive after an intentional close are ignored instead of being mis-reported as empty-response errors.
- **`doGenerate` abort signal** ([#31](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/31)) - The non-streaming path now forwards `options.abortSignal` to the prompt request, so aborting `generateText` cancels the underlying HTTP request instead of leaving it pending. A caller-initiated abort now surfaces as an `AbortError` (previously a generic empty-response error) and best-effort aborts the server-side session to stop generation.
- **Non-streaming native structured output (`json_schema`)** ([#32](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/32)) - `generateText` with `Output.object()` / `Output.array()` (and `generateObject`) failed deterministically with `AI_NoOutputGeneratedError: No output generated.` even though the OpenCode server returned a valid structured result. OpenCode 1.17.x ends a `format: json_schema` turn on the `StructuredOutput` tool call, so the assistant message finishes with `"tool-calls"`; the provider reported that as a non-`stop` finish reason, and the AI SDK only parses structured output when the final step finishes with `stop`. The provider already flattens the `StructuredOutput` tool call into text content, so both `doGenerate` and the streaming path now report `finishReason: "stop"` (preserving the raw `tool-calls` value) when a completed `StructuredOutput` part is present. Streaming (`streamObject` / `streamText`) was unaffected because the AI SDK parses streamed output regardless of finish reason, but its finish event now also reports `stop` for consistency.
- **Hyphenated finish reasons** ([#32](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/32)) - `mapOpencodeFinishReason` now recognizes the AI SDK-style hyphenated finish values OpenCode actually stores (`"tool-calls"`, `"content-filter"`) in addition to the provider-style `tool_use`/`tool_calls`/`content_filter` values; previously they fell through to `"other"`.

## [3.0.5] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Exported `createEmptyResponseDataError`** - New error factory alongside the existing `createAPICallError` / `createTimeoutError` exports.

### Fixed

- **CJS type declarations (FalseESM)** - Split the `exports["."]` conditions so `require` resolves the CommonJS declarations (`./dist/index.d.cts`) that the build already emitted, instead of the ESM `./dist/index.d.ts`. Previously, TypeScript consumers using `require()` under `node16`/`nodenext` module resolution got a "Masquerading as ESM" error from `@arethetypeswrong/cli`; both `publint` and `attw --pack` are now clean across all resolution modes.
- **Empty response data errors** - Prompt calls that succeed but return no response data (the behavior of opencode CLI 1.17.x for invalid or unavailable `provider/model` IDs, e.g. the `github-copilot/gpt-5` repro from [#21](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/issues/21)) now throw an actionable `APICallError` that names the requested model ID, suggests checking `opencode models`, includes the server error payload when available, and carries `errorType: "EmptyResponseData"` — replacing the generic `No response data from OpenCode`. The streaming path surfaces the same error as an `error` stream part and terminates the stream instead of hanging on the event subscription.
- **`wrapError` double-wrapping** - `wrapError` now returns already-wrapped AI SDK errors (`APICallError`, `LoadAPIKeyError`) unchanged instead of re-wrapping them and losing their metadata.
- **Singleton client manager recovery after dispose** - `OpencodeClientManager.dispose()` now releases the singleton slot when the disposed manager is the singleton, so a later `createOpencode()` builds a fresh client manager. Previously the singleton kept pointing at the disposed instance, and every subsequent provider in the same process failed with `Client manager has been disposed`.
- **client-options example** - Step 2 of `examples/client-options.ts` now genuinely demonstrates the preconfigured-client pattern by passing an isolated manager via `clientManager: OpencodeClientManager.createInstance({ client })`. Previously the preconfigured client was handed to the singleton that step 1 had already initialized, so it was ignored and step 2's requests flowed through step 1's client while the demo reported success. The example now also echoes each outgoing request's `x-demo-source` header so the output proves which client served it, drops a spurious `await` on the synchronous v2 `createOpencodeClient()`, and allows overriding the example model via `OPENCODE_MODEL`.

### Changed

- **Clearer stale-options warnings** - The client manager's "already initialized" warnings now point at the escape hatches that actually work (`OpencodeClientManager.createInstance()` with the `clientManager` provider setting, or `OpencodeClientManager.resetInstance()`) instead of the previous generic advice.
- **`clientOptions.responseStyle` normalization** - Managed clients are now always created with fields-style SDK results; `clientOptions.responseStyle: "data"` is ignored with a warning since the provider's response handling requires `{ data, error }` results. Session-creation and prompt result handling also tolerate data-style results from caller-supplied (preconfigured) clients.

## [3.0.4] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **Empty OpenCode response errors** - Empty-body JSON parse failures from the OpenCode server (`SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input`, most commonly caused by an invalid or unavailable `provider/model` ID) are now wrapped in an actionable `APICallError` that names the requested model ID and likely cause. The same wrapping is applied to the streaming prompt failure path, and `modelId` is now included in API call error metadata. (Fixes [#21](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/issues/21), PR [#24](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/24) by [@slegarraga](https://github.com/slegarraga))
- **image-input example** - Updated `examples/image-input.ts` to use `openai/gpt-5.5` instead of the no-longer-available `openai/gpt-5.3-codex`, which caused the example to fail silently (empty response, zero usage).

## [3.0.3] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **Tool approval ordering** - Buffered OpenCode `permission.asked` events until the correlated tool call is registered, preventing AI SDK `ToolCallNotFoundForApprovalError` failures for provider-executed tools that require approval. Also treats early approval registration as closing the tool-input envelope so stale post-registration `running` updates cannot emit late `tool-input-delta` chunks. (Fixes [#22](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/issues/22), PR [#23](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/23) by [@JulieLorin](https://github.com/JulieLorin))

## [3.0.2] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Structured output support** - OpenCode's `StructuredOutput` tool input is now re-emitted as text content so the AI SDK's `Output.object()` / `Output.array()` can parse `step.text` correctly. Previously this always threw `NoObjectGeneratedError`. (PR [#16](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/16) by [@abhijit-hota](https://github.com/abhijit-hota))
- **Exported `STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_TOOL` constant** - Shared constant for the `"StructuredOutput"` tool name.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **User message ID passthrough** - Added support for `providerOptions.opencode.messageID` to control the user message ID sent to OpenCode. Must start with `"msg_"`. (PR [#14](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/14) by [@abhijit-hota](https://github.com/abhijit-hota))
- **Exported `OpencodeProviderOptions` type** - New type in `src/types.ts` documenting the per-request provider options surface.

### Fixed

- **Session creation error messages** - `Failed to create session` now includes the server error payload for easier debugging.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-17

### Changed

- **Breaking: multi-slash model ID parsing now matches OpenCode upstream** - Model IDs containing multiple `/` separators now use the first segment as `providerID` and preserve the remaining path as `modelID` (for example, `litellm/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` now resolves to `providerID: "litellm"` and `modelID: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"`). This changes behavior for integrations that relied on the previous last-segment parsing, so the release is being published as `3.0.0` to avoid silently breaking consumers pinned to `^2.x`.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Streaming delta handling** - Added support for `message.part.delta` events to enable true incremental text and reasoning streaming instead of batch delivery via `message.part.updated` only. (PR [#9](https://github.com/ben-vargas/ai-sdk-provider-opencode-sdk/pull/9) by [@abhijit-hota](https://github.com/abhijit-hota))
- **User-message filtering for deltas** - Applied user-role guard to `handlePartDelta` to prevent user prompt text from leaking into assistant stream output, matching existing filtering in `handlePartUpdated`.

### Changed

- **Dependencies** - Bumped `@opencode-ai/sdk` from `^1.1.65` to `^1.2.15`.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Isolated client manager instances** - Added `OpencodeClientManager.createInstance()` for creating standalone (non-singleton) client managers, enabling concurrent sessions pointing at different servers.
- **Client manager injection** - Added `clientManager` option on `OpencodeProviderSettings` to use a custom client manager instead of the shared singleton.
- **Validation for conflicting options** - Added warning when both `clientManager` and `client` are provided.

### Changed

- **OpencodeClient type** - Aligned `OpencodeClient` type alias to the SDK-exported `OpencodeClient` type directly instead of inferring from `createOpencodeClient` return type.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **SDK client passthrough options** - Added `clientOptions` on `OpencodeProviderSettings` to forward OpenCode `createOpencodeClient()` configuration (headers, auth, fetch, serializers, validators, transformers, throwOnError, and RequestInit-compatible options).
- **Preconfigured client support** - Added `client` on `OpencodeProviderSettings` to use a prebuilt OpenCode SDK client directly.
- **Client configuration example** - Added `examples/client-options.ts` showing `clientOptions` passthrough and preconfigured `client` usage patterns.

### Changed

- **Client initialization behavior** - `clientOptions` are now applied consistently across external `baseUrl`, existing-server, and auto-started-server client creation paths.
- **Conflict handling** - Reserved `baseUrl` and `directory` values in `clientOptions` are ignored with warnings; `client` takes precedence over `clientOptions`.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-13

- **Breaking release** - OpenCode SDK v2 migration and AI SDK v6 hardening.

### Changed

- **OpenCode SDK v2 cutover** - Migrated runtime client/server integration to `@opencode-ai/sdk/v2`.
- **Request shape updates** - Updated session APIs to v2 parameter style (`sessionID`, top-level args) instead of legacy `path/body`.
- **Structured output** - Mapped AI SDK JSON response format to OpenCode native `format: { type: \"json_schema\", schema }`.
- **Dependencies** - Bumped to latest stable compatible versions:
  - `@opencode-ai/sdk` -> `^1.1.65`
  - `@ai-sdk/provider` -> `^3.0.8`
  - `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` -> `^4.0.15`
  - `ai` (dev) -> `^6.0.85`

### Added

- **Permission/approval flow** - Added support for OpenCode permission events as AI SDK `tool-approval-request` stream parts.
- **Approval response handling** - Applied `tool-approval-response` prompt parts through OpenCode `permission.reply()` before sending prompts.
- **New model settings** - Added `permission`, `variant`, `directory`, and `outputFormatRetryCount` settings.
- **File/source streaming output** - Added conversion for OpenCode file parts and source metadata into AI SDK `file` / `source` stream/content parts.
- **Provider lifecycle cleanup API** - Added provider `dispose()` method for managed server/client cleanup.
- **Event typing exports** - Added `EventQuestionAsked` export for SDK v2 question events.
- **Approval metadata** - Added `approvalRequestId` in provider metadata for approval request correlation.

### Fixed

- **Finish reason mapping** - Added `ContextOverflowError` and `StructuredOutputError` handling in finish-reason conversion.
- **Output-length detection** - Treated `ContextOverflowError` as output-length overflow for AI SDK error utilities.
